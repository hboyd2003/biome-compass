# `Biome Compass`

This fork has been updated to 1.20.6!
The update is based on [Craftless's](https://github.com/Craftless) [fork](https://github.com/Craftless) which was updated to 1.20.1. You can find the original (archived) mod repo here: [Biome Compass](https://github.com/Craftless)


Works like [Nature's Compass](https://github.com/MattCzyr/NaturesCompass) but completely server-side! Just right click and select a biome you want to search for! The compass will tell you the coordinates of the nearest biome and its coordinates, if you are in creative you can teleport to it by shift right clicking too!

### `Recipe`
The recipe can use any type of log or sapling!
